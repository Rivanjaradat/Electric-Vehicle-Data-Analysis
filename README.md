# Electric Vehicle Data Analysis

This repository contains a solution to an assignment focused on data analysis and exploration using a real-world dataset on electric vehicles. The project involves various stages of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to derive meaningful insights about electric vehicle trends and patterns.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset**: Electric Vehicle Population Data
- **Source**: [Data.gov - Electric Vehicle Population Data](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data)
- **Description**: This dataset provides information about battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) registered in Washington State. It includes details on vehicle registration location, make, model, type, range, and other relevant attributes.

## Objectives

The key objectives of this project include:
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values through various strategies.
   - Encoding categorical variables and normalizing numerical data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Generating descriptive statistics for numerical features.
   - Visualizing the distribution and popularity of EVs across regions and models.
   - Exploring correlations and patterns between various features.
3. **Visualization**:
   - Creating informative visualizations, including histograms, scatter plots, bar charts, and maps, to enhance data interpretation and insights.
4. **Optional Analysis**:
   - Conducting temporal trend analysis if temporal data is available.
